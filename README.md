# 2018_IMY320_TeamNamesSucc
# Introduction
Our group consists of two Computer Science members:
- Jason Davidson (16044984)
- James Hertzog (16011822)

This project is intended for the University of Pretoria module IMY320.
For our game we have chosen [Inlight](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/sunnysideinteractive/inlight-0), an atmospheric and intense 2D game.
_Please note that this group does not possess a member that is currently enrolled in the multimedia game module. However, as per the instructions we have picked out a game off of Kickstarter and are confident in our ability to deliver a well-designed web experience_.
# Design
### Overview
Our design for the website is a single scrollable page. We want the general look and feel of the page to be minimal but functional. The page will consist (possibly) of no [Navigation](###navigation) as a result of being completely scrollable. The different sections will describe their relative content in a unique color. This gives each section their own feeling. The colors will be dependent on the predominant color pallet of the image visual that we select, in order to tie the whole section together and maintain that mental coupling of its contents.
### Look and Feel
The webpage will adhere to a minimalist design philosophy - less is more. As such the website will be a single page and will be a continuous scroll experience, this promotes a unification in the processing of the content we provide the user.
The color pallet of the webpage will consist of a black or dark background and non-foreground elements will appear in a lighter shade of either color. The different content sections will each have a unique bright contrasting color to stand out against the background of the webpage. This creates an eye catching effect and when we color text the same color as these headings, they become easier to associate and remember.
### Navigation
For our initial design we feel the best navigation could well be no navigation. With the whole page being scrollable there is little need for a menu bar to clutter the space.
We do however believe a minimal non-intrusive navigation linking to each section header could be a possible option, it would have to float at either the top or bottom of the screen and provide a transparent but visible menu that highlights the current section header menu item.
_This is however not our first choice but we thought to mention it and are open to feedback._
### Initial View
For the initial view (what is displayed first when the webpage loads and the top of the scrollable page). We thought to have a flashy and eye catching graphic that blends itself seamlessly with the [background](###look-and-feel). This graphic would be an animated image such as a `.gif` or `.webm`. it is important that this image be striking to the user and sets the tone for the rest of the webpage. As such it should possess bright contrasting colors against a black or dark background that will be carried over to the pageâ€™s own background, and the colors used as anchors for the coming sections.
### Story
This section of the webpage is the first one the user encounters as they scroll down away from the [Initial View](###initial-view) and is responsible for describing the story of the game to the user simply and avoiding verbose explanation to avoid tiring the user.
The story section of the webpage will possess multiple image-text 'blocks' that describe an element of the story and provide a graphic example or aid in this case. The story section will follow the color guidelines as set out by the [Look and Feel](###look-and-feel) of the webpage.
### Gameplay
This section of the webpage will come after the [Story](###story) section of the webpage and will provide a few examples of gameplay as well as a short description. This will most probably be Ability names and a few interesting features. The Gameplay section will follow the color guidelines set out by the [Look and Feel](###look-and-feel) of the webpage.
### Team
This section will come after the [Gameplay](###gameplay) section and will give some information regarding the Development Team and their respective company and 'About Us' information. It will also include some information regarding the designers of the webpage, again following the color rules set by the [Look and Feel](###look-and-feel).
